## Windows Header Namespace Sanitizer

@@@ Feature Overview @@@

The `SimpleConflictsFixer` is a specialized header designed to prevent naming collisions between the Windows API and modern C/C++ libraries or custom user code.
It specifically targets common function names that `windows.h` defines as macros, which often "pollute" the global namespace.

-> Platform Specific: This module only executes logic if $_WIN32$ is defined.
--> Target Version: Forces $_WIN32_WINNT$ to $0x0600$ (Windows Vista or higher).

| Collision Management
|
| -- > Temporary Macro Redefinition
|    | -- > $CloseWindow$ -> $WinCloseWindow$ 
|    | -- > $ShowCursor$ -> $WinShowCursor$ 
|    | -- > $Rectangle$ -> $WinRectangle$ 
|    | -- > $DrawText$ -> $WinDrawText$ 
|
| -- > Post-Include Cleanup
|    | -- > All temporary $Win$ macros are $#undef$ after headers are loaded.
|    | -- > Explicitly $#undef interface$ to prevent COM conflicts.

## Protected Headers
The following system headers are wrapped by this fixer to ensure they do not break external logic:

1.  $winsock2.h$ 
2.  $windows.h$ 
3.  $objbase.h$ 

$$ High Priority $$
\\ This header should be included BEFORE other QOL modules that utilize networking or graphics to ensure symbols like "Rectangle" remain available for custom use. \\
